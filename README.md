It will be able to play anything.

For both assignments regarding React:

1. Use customs hooks and/or context. It's important that
you show you understand how to create custom hooks and
understand context, how to create and use context and pass it 
down your app.

2. Use functional components
3. Seperate components and hooks into individual files
4. Check the console to make sure you fix all errors.
You shouldn't have any errors.

A note on the search function: You can make the search as 
you type or wait until you finish typing and click 'search'. 
In real production apps, the search should happen as you 
type if all the data has been loaded to the local cache. If it 
hasn't been loaded to the local cache, then only send the 
search to the server after the user has finished typing. Since 
this is a quick and simple test, either is okay.


After you have completed the assignments, please push it
to your own repos on GitHub and let me know the links. I'll
go read your code.

Thank you.
